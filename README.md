This repository contains Siemens NX projects from 2023 to 2025, showcasing my experience with CAD modeling and assembly design. Notable projects include a functional nutcracker assembly, where all files starting with nc must be downloaded for the complete model, and a replica of Sputnik, requiring all files starting with Sputnik for full assembly. The repository includes NX part files (.prt), which should be opened in Siemens NX with all related components in the same directory to avoid missing references.
